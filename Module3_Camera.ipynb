Additionally, this value is stored as a bgr8 file (standing for blue, green, red, 8 bit), and the np.array function basically simplifies the way it is stored (in an easier to understand format).\n",

    "However, to display the image, we need to store it as a jpeg image. Luckily, jetbot has a function for this labeled as bgr8_to_jpeg. By calling this function with the image as an argument, we now have an image stored as a JPEG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we need to display the image in Jupyter Notebook. One of the ways we display any outputs is using the display() command. But simply passing jpeg_image to display will print the data as it is stored (with numbers and characters), and not as a picture. Therefore, we need the Image() command, and pass the jpeg_image to the argument data within.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will only output one picture, since the block is only being run once. If we want to continuously output a live feed from the camera, we can implement these features in a loop as shown below."
